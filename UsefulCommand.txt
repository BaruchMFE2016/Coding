Some useful command:
(1)The default working dictionary is in: c/Users/Xinlu Xiao
   so if you want or modify the dictionary, you can just put in
   "cd Coding" (this will lead you to the Coding dictionary)
(2)要建立一个远程库，使用命令 
   git remote add origin git@github.com:XinluXiao/Coding.git
(3)关联后，使用命令
   git push -u origin master
(4) Remember to put the file under the dictionary
    if you want to check the dictionary, just put in "pwd"
